<h3>
  Welcome to the Josh coding challenge!

<hr>
<h2>To run:</h2> fork the repo, clone onto your computer, run 'npm i' in your terminal, and enjoy!

<h2>
  How is it built?
</h2>
<p>
  This application is built using React, and the Star Wars API (SWAPI). If you'd like to check the API out, <a href='https://swapi.dev/api'>Click here.</a>
  <br>
  The packages use to build this application are BrowserRouter, Route, and Switch from react-router-dom.
</p>

<p>
  This challenge was a lot more challenging that I had thought at the start, and because of that I still have a to-do list!
</p>
<h2>Remaining to-do's:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Figure out how to fetch data from the keys that contain API links as values in order to display the actual data.</li>
  <li>Display data from the following keys: people, films, vehicles, and starships.</li>
  <li>Give this application the styling it deserves once all data can be fetched and displayed without issue.</li>
  <li>Implement a search feature so you can search for people, species, etc.</li>
</ol>
<br><br>

  I'm excited to continue working on this until I learn how to complete all of my to-do's. Thanks for looking. (:
